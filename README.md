1. Project Title

🚚 Supply Chain Insights: End-to-End Analytics Dashboard
An interactive data visualization tool built to analyze and optimize product sales, supplier performance, inventory management, and transportation efficiency across the supply chain.

2. Short Description 
The Supply Chain Insights Dashboard is a comprehensive Power BI report designed to help businesses monitor revenue, costs, supplier efficiency, product demand, and logistics performance. It empowers decision-makers to reduce costs, improve supplier management, and optimize transportation strategies for greater profitability.

3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
📊 Power BI Desktop – Core platform for data visualization and dashboard development.
📂 Power Query – Data cleaning, shaping, and transformation layer.
🧮 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated KPIs, custom measures, and dynamic insights.
📝 Data Modeling – Relationships built between product, supplier, SKU, and transportation tables to enable cross-analysis.
📁 File Format – .pbix for development, .pdf for reporting, and .png for visual snapshots.

4. Data Source

Source: Dataset provided in the YouTube tutorial (Supply Chain project).
The data covers multiple dimensions of the supply chain including:
Products: SKU-level details, product categories (cosmetics, skincare, haircare), pricing, and sales volumes.
Suppliers: Profit margins, defect rates, manufacturing and shipping costs, and stock levels.
Customers: Revenue by demographics (male, female, non-binary, unknown).
Logistics: Transportation modes (road, rail, sea, air), costs, lead times, and defect rates.
5. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem
Supply chain operations often struggle with high costs, supplier inefficiencies, inventory risks, and transportation bottlenecks. Without a centralized analytical tool, managers cannot easily identify cost drivers, product demand patterns, or supplier reliability.
• Goal of the Dashboard
To provide a single interactive reporting platform that:
Tracks revenue, costs, and margins across products and suppliers.
Analyzes defect rates and supplier performance for quality assurance.
Identifies transportation mode efficiency and cost trade-offs.
Supports data-driven decision-making for supply chain optimization.
